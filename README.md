# amiga500_svideo
 Luma Chroma output from A500

GGLabs A520HD redraw with AD724 based SVIDEO.

Connector PCB to fit on the right side behind the floppy.

To keep the video port operational I will do high impedance input (not 75 ohm) tap directly to video hybrid circuit and adjust input level via resistor divider. 
The same applies to AD724. It needs 714mVpp so I _think_ it needs 1/2nd of the A500HD output. But we shall see.

Work in progress - not made, not tested yet.
