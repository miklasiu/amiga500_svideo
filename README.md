# amiga500_svideo
 Luma Chroma output from A500

GGLabs A520HD redraw with AD724 based SVIDEO.

Connector PCB to fit on the right side behind the floppy.

To keep the video port operational I will do high impedance input (not 75 ohm) tap directly to video hybrid circuit and adjust input level via resistor divider. 
The same applies to AD724. It needs 714mVpp so I _think_ it needs 1/2nd of the A500HD output. But we shall see.

Work in progress - not made, not tested yet.

BTW - I just bought my 1st Amiga in 2022. So I am ~30years behind. Catching up. 
Just noticed all mods cost more than A500. It seems cheaper and surely funnier to do them myself.
Fortunately it is broken so more projects coming as original parts are expensive too :D
